            <h4>ATARI</h4>
            <p>
                Atari is a brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA.
                The original Atari, Inc., founded in Sunnyvale, California in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, was a pioneer in arcade games,
                home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as Pong and the Atari 2600,
                helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1984, as a result of the video game crash of 1983, the original Atari Inc. was split, and the arcade division was turned into Atari Games Inc.
                Atari Games received the rights to use the logo and brand name with appended text "Games" on arcade games,
                as well as rights to the original 1972â€“1984 arcade hardware properties. The Atari Consumer Electronics Division properties
                were in turn sold to Jack Tramiel's Tramel Technology Ltd., which then renamed itself to Atari Corporation.
                In 1996, Atari Corporation reverse-merged with disk-drive manufacturer JT Storage (JTS), becoming a division within the company.
                In 1998, Hasbro Interactive acquired all Atari Corporation related properties from JTS, creating a new subsidiary, Atari Interactive.</p>

            <p>
                Infogrames Entertainment (IESA) bought Hasbro Interactive in 2001 and renamed it Infogrames Interactive, which intermittently
                published Atari branded titles. In 2003, it renamed the division Atari Interactive. Another IESA division, Infogrames Inc. (formerly GT Interactive),
                changed its name to Atari Inc. the same year, licensing the Atari name and logo from its fellow subsidiary.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2008, IESA completed its acquisition of Atari, Inc.'s outstanding stock, making it a wholly owned subsidiary.
                IESA renamed itself Atari, SA in 2009. It sought bankruptcy protection under French law in January 2013.
